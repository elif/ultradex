# AGENTS.md - Guidelines for AI-Assisted Development

This document provides guidelines for AI agents contributing to the UltrAdex project.

## General Principles

1.  **Understand the Goal:** Before making changes, ensure you understand the user's request and the overall objectives of the UltrAdex project as outlined in `README.md` and `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
2.  **Prioritize Clarity:** Code should be clear, well-commented (where necessary), and easy for human developers to understand.
3.  **Follow Requirements:** Adhere to the specifications outlined in `REQUIREMENTS.md` unless explicitly told otherwise by the user.
4.  **Iterative Development:** For complex features, propose a plan and seek user approval. Break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
5.  **Test Your Code:** While full test automation might not be in place initially, always manually verify your changes or write simple tests if applicable. (Future goal: Implement a testing framework).
6.  **Use Existing Tools/Libraries:** Prefer using established libraries or APIs (like the Pok√©mon TCG API mentioned in requirements) over reimplementing complex functionality.
7.  **Communicate:** If a request is unclear, or if you encounter significant roadblocks, communicate with the user using `request_user_input`. Provide updates on your progress.

## Coding Style (General - to be refined)

*   **Language:** This is a ruby/rails 7 project using hotwire ux and redis backend. The only language other than ruby is lua for redis stored procedures.
*   **Formatting:** strict adherance to ruby idioms like DRY, principle of least surprise, code should read like english. do not include extra syntax if it is not needed (like optional parenthesis)
*   **Naming Conventions:** Use natural language names for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., `get_card_details` instead of `gcd()`).
*   **Modularity:** Strive for clear object encapsulation. Even where it results in small files, maintain object oriented principles and separate object domain functionality in a consistent manner.

## File and Project Structure

*   Keep the project organized. New files should be placed in logical directories consistent with rails paradigms.
*   Refer to `REQUIREMENTS.md` for the planned data schema and features.

## Specific Tool Usage

*   When modifying existing files, use `replace_with_git_merge_diff` for targeted changes.
*   Use `overwrite_file_with_block` only when replacing an entire file's content is intended and appropriate.
*   Use `create_file_with_block` for new files.
*   Always provide clear and concise commit messages when using `submit`.



By following these guidelines, AI agents can contribute effectively and help build a high-quality UltrAdex application.
