# UltrAdex - Pokémon Card Master Set Organizer

UltrAdex is a tool designed to help Pokémon TCG collectors organize and track their progress towards completing "master sets." A master set, for the purpose of this tool, is defined as every unique front printing of a card for a specific Pokémon species.

## Key Features (Planned)

*   **Comprehensive Card Database:** Access to data for a vast number of Pokémon card printings.
*   **Master Set Definition:** Define the Pokémon species you aim to collect.
*   **Collection Tracking:** Mark the cards you own and see your completion progress.
*   **Customizable Placeholders:** Generate printable placeholders for cards you're missing, tailored with the information you want to see (e.g., card image, set name, number, price). These are perfect for organizing your binders.
*   **Search & Filtering:** Easily find specific cards or browse through sets.
